A web server in Chicago hosts static web content that a website visitor located in Washington, D.C., requests.
Once the origin server in Chicago receives the request, it sends a response to the website visitor. Simultaneously, it delivers a copy of the response to the CDN point-of-presence (POP) that's geographically closest to the website visitor.
The CDN POP stores its copy as a cached file.
When the same visitor or another visitor in that location makes a similar request again, the caching server -- not the origin server -- delivers the response
